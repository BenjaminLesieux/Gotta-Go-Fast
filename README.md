# Gotta-Go-Fast

School project at EFREI Paris. The goal was to create a game using python, and we chose to make a platformer as it is one of the most basic form of games and yet fun to make.

# Installation

1. Install python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. While installing check `add to path` absolutely, and install pip (for custom install)
3. Then download [Gotta-Go-Fast.zip](https://github.com/BenjaminLesieux/Gotta-Go-Fast/releases) and unzip it
4. Then click the `setup.bat` if you're on windows, if not, install pip and pygame (`python pip install pygame`), make sure pygame is 2.0.0 or earlier
5. WHen it's done, juste launch ggf.bat file ! If it doesn't work, or you're not on windows, execute GottaGoFast.py with python (`python GottaGoFast.py`)

Enjoy !


Remarks : game is in french, and play is with ZQSD, not WASD (use arrows anyways)
